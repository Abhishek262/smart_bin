# Smart-Bins
* Files to be placed in Raspberry Pi are in PI/
* Files to be placed in the Server are in SERVER/
* Directory structures are mentioned within ```location.md``` in both Pi and Server

## Requirements
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* SSH along with key setup between Pi and Server
* Python3


## How to run
